LightGBM
https://www.analyticssteps.com/blogs/what-light-gbm-algorithm-how-use-it
Not apropriate for this problem as it requires a training set of size 10,000+. It can easily overfit small data due to its sensitivity.

XGBRegressor

One of the reasons for good performance is Regularization. A technique that is used to get rid of overfitting of the model.
